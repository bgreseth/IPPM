\begin{enumerate}

% this problem is OK.
\item \emph{Are males more reckless than females?} The file
  \texttt{speed\_gender\_height.csv} contains 1,325 observations on
  gender, height, and the fastest speed ever driven (in mph) for a
  sample of college students.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a boxplot of speed by gender. That is to say, make one
  boxplot for males and one boxplot for females, but put them
  side-by-side on the same plot.
\item Make an x--y plot with height on the x--axis and speed on the
  y--axis. Color the plotted points according to gender. Place a
  legend that shows the color associations. Another option is to use
  different plotting symbols rather than color to distinguish males
  and females.
