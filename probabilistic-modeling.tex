\section{Modeling with Probability Distributions}

% use this section to illustrate modeling with a poisson rv
At a facility that manufactures recreational sports
  vehicles (ATVs), each vehicle is subjected to a final
  inspection. The rate of defects during final inspection is
  $\lambda=1.5$ defects per vehicle.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is an appropriate probability distribution to model the
number of defects? \label{atv1}
\item What proportion of vehicles have more than 2 defects? \label{atv2}
\item Management has set a new goal that the proportion
of vehicles with no defects is .5. What rate $\lambda$ would
achieve this goal? \label{atv3}
\end{enumerate}

We are interested in the number of defects, which is discrete.
The Poisson distribution makes sense because it is commonly used
for count data. Moreover, we are given information for a single
parameter, and the Poisson distribution has a single parameter.
If we let the random variable $X$ represent the number of defects
per vehicle, then a reasonable distribution is
\[ X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda=1.5) \]
For part~\ref{atv2},
\begin{align*}
P(X>2) &= 1 - P(X \leq 2)\\
       &= 1 - \sum_{x=0}^2 \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}\\
       &= 0.191
\end{align*}
For part \ref{atv3}, management's goal is that $P(X=0)=0.5$, or
\[ P(X=0) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^0}{0!} = e^{-\lambda}=0.5 \]
Then
\[ \lambda = -\ln{0.5} = 0.693 \]

\section{Stochastic Processes}

\emph{A Poisson Process.} A statistician has observed the behavior of a Hollywood celebrity for
about one year and has noted that between the hours of 8pm and 11pm
this celebrity generates, on average, three tweets per hour and that
the rate is approximately the same within each one-hour period.  We
can count the \emph{number} of tweets that occur in a time interval
$t$. We can also measure the \emph{time} between tweets. Here is a
depiction of the tweets from last night.

\vspace{.2in}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw (0,0) -- (11,0)
  node[pos=0.35/11]{x}
  node[pos=0.87/11]{x}
  node[pos=4.74/11]{x}
  node[pos=5.05/11]{x}
  node[pos=5.92/11]{x}
  node[pos=6.65/11]{x}
  node[pos=6.93/11]{x}
  node[pos=8.50/11]{x}
  node[pos=10.07/11]{x}
;
\node[below] at (0,-.2) {8pm};
\draw (0,-.2) -- (0,.2);
\node[below] at (11/3,-.2) {9pm};
\draw (11/3,-.2) -- (11/3,.2);
\node[below] at (22/3,-.2) {10pm};
\draw (22/3,-.2) -- (22/3,.2);
\node[below] at (11,-.2) {11pm};
\draw (11,-.2) -- (11,.2);


\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Let the random variable $Y$ be the number of tweets from
the celebrity in some time interval.
When we say that the number of tweets in a time interval $t$ follows
a Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda t$, we write
\[
  Y \sim \text{Poisson($\lambda t$)}
\]
If $t$ is one hour, then we can write
\[
  Y \sim \text{Poisson($\lambda = 3$)}
\]
Stating that the number of tweets follows a Poisson distribution
implies that the time between tweets follows an Exponential
distribution (and vice versa). Let the random variable $X$ be
the time between tweets. Then
\[
  Y \sim \text{Poisson($\lambda t$)} \Longleftrightarrow X \sim \text{Exp($\lambda$)}
\]
Yes, it is the same $\lambda$ in each distribution.
The average number of tweets is $\lambda=3$ per hour. The average
time between tweets is $1/\lambda = 1/3$ hour (or 20 minutes).
Recall that for the Exponential distribution
\[
  E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{1~\text{hour}}{3~\text{tweets}} = 20 ~\text{minutes per tweet on average}
\]

Questions.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the probability that the celebrity sends out five
  or more tweets in one hour?
\item What is the probability that the celebrity sends out
  no tweets between 9pm and 11pm?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Queueing Models}

\section{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Modeling with Probability Distributions.}

% this problem is OK
\item \emph{Evaluating a warranty.}
  A manufacturer of automotive batteries offers a one-year
  warranty. If the battery fails for any reason during the warranty
  period, it is replaced for free. The time to failure is distributed
  Exponential with rate $\lambda=.125$ failures per year.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What proportion of batteries fail within the warranty period?
\item The cost to manufacture a battery is \$50, and the profit
per battery is \$25. What is the effect of the warranty replacement
policy on profit? \label{ex:profit}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
  \bs The question is asking for the theoretical proportion of
  batteries that fail within one year. Since all batteries have the
  same probability of failure, this proportion is equal to the
  probability that a single battery will fail within one year. Let $X$
  be a random variable that represents the time to failure.
\[ P(X<1) = 1-e^{-\lambda t} = 1 - e^{-.125} = 0.118 \]
Now, imagine that the manufacturer has, over time,
  sold many batteries and has kept data on how many batteries failed
  within one year. The empirical proportion is simply the number
  of batteries that failed divided by the number of batteries sold.
  The Law of Large Numbers tells us that when the number of batteries
  sold is large, the empirical proportion will be approximately
  equal to the theoretical proportion.

Taking the warranty into account, the average profit per battery is
\[ \$25 - 0.118\times \$50 = \$19.10 \]
So, the (average) effect of the warranty on profit is -\$5.90.
\end{solution}

% this problem needs to be re-written
\item \emph{Selling tickets.}
  The Springdale High School band is performing a benefit concert
  in its new 400-seat auditorium. Local businesses buy the tickets in
  blocks of 10 and donate them to youth organizations. Tickets go on
  sale to business entities for four hours only the day before the
  concert. The process of placing orders for tickets is Poisson with a
  mean 10 calls per hour.  Any (blocks of) tickets remaining after the
  box office is closed are sold at a discount as ``rush tickets'' one hour
  before the concert starts. Determine the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The probability that it will be possible to buy rush tickets. \label{ex:rusha}
\item  The average number of rush tickets available. \label{ex:rushb}
\end{enumerate}

For part~\ref{ex:rusha}, you should first write down the expression
for the probability that it will be possible to buy ``rush''
tickets. To compute the numerical answer, you will want to use
software such as R.

\begin{solution}
\bs
First note that the number of calls in one hour is distributed
Poisson with mean 10. Consequently, the number of calls in a 4--hour
period is distributed Poisson with mean 40. Let $N$ be the
number of calls in a 4--hour period. Then
\[ N ~ \text{Poisson}(\lambda = 40) \]
For part~\ref{ex:rusha}, the probability that tickets remain after they
are offered to the local businesses is
\begin{align*}
  P(N < 40) &= \sum_{n=0}^{39} \frac{\lambda^n e^{-\lambda}}{n!}\\
            &= \sum_{n=0}^{39} \frac{40^n e^{-40}}{n!}\\
            &\approx .48
\end{align*}
In R,
\begin{Verbatim}
> sum(dpois(0:39,40))
[1] 0.4789711
\end{Verbatim}  

For part~\ref{ex:rushb}, our calculations are all done in expectation
(or on average). There are 40 calls in 4 hours,
which means that 400 tickets are sold to local
businesses. So, on average, no rush tickets are available.
\end{solution}

% this problem needs to be re-written, but it can be very similar
\item \emph{College expenses.}
  A freshman student receives a bank deposit of
  \$100 a month from home to cover incidentals. Withdrawal checks of
  \$20 each occur randomly during the month and are spaced according to
  an exponential distribution with a mean value of 1 week.  Determine
  the probability that the student will run out of incidental money
  before the end of the fourth week.

\begin{solution}
\bs
Let $X$ be a random variable that represents the time between
checks. The mean time between checks, that is to say the
expected value of $X$ ($E(X)$), is one week. We know that for
the Exponential distribution
\[ E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \]
where $\lambda$ is the rate (in units of checks
per week). So,
\[ X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda = 1~\text{check per week}) \]
If the time between checks is distributed Exponential with
rate $\lambda$, then the number of checks written in $t$ weeks
is Poisson with mean $\lambda t$. Let $N$ be the number of checks
written in 4 weeks.
\[ N \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda = \lambda \times 4 = 4) \]
Now, the probability that the student runs out of money is
\begin{align*}
  P(N \geq 5) &= 1 - P(N \leq 4) \\
              &= 1 - \sum_{n=0}^{4} \frac{\lambda^n e^{-\lambda}}{n!}\\
              &= .37
\end{align*}
You may have defined the event that the student runs out of money as
$P(N = 5)$. In other words, that the student writes exactly five
checks.  This is incorrect because we are modeling the student's
check-writing activity as a Poisson process. In other words, the
(unstated) assumption is that the number of checks written is
independent of the available funds. (Probably closer to reality?)
\end{solution}

% this problem needs to be re-written, but it can be very similar.
\item \emph{Stocking an item in inventory.}
Demand for an item occurs according to a Poisson distribution with
mean 3 per day. The maximum stock level is 25 items, which occurs on
each Monday immediately after a new order is received. The order size
depends on the number of units left at the end of the week on Saturday
(business is closed on Sundays). Determine the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The average weekly size of the order. \label{ex:asize}
\item The probability of shortage at the start of business on Friday. \label{ex:pshort}
\item The probability that the weekly order size exceeds 10 units. \label{ex:pex}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
\bs
For part~\ref{ex:asize}, the distribution of demand over six days is
Poisson with mean 18 items. So, the average weekly size
of the order is 18 items.

For part~\ref{ex:pshort}, shortage at the start of business on Friday means
that all 25 items sold during Monday through Thursday. Let
$D4$ be a random variable that represents demand over the
first four days of the week.
\[ D4 \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda = 12) \]
The probability of shortage at the start of the day on Friday is
\begin{align*}
  P(D4 \geq 25) &= 1 - P(D4 \leq 24)\\
                &= 1 - \sum_{n=0}^{24} \frac{12^n e^{-12}}{n!}\\
                &\approx 0.0007
\end{align*}
In R,
\begin{Verbatim}
> 1 - sum(dpois(0:24,12))
[1] 0.0006856332
\end{Verbatim}

For part~\ref{ex:pex}, the order size will exceed 10 units whenever more than
10 items are sold during the six days of the week. Let $D6$ be
the demand over one week, then
\[ D6 \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda = 18) \]
and the probability that the order size exceeds 10 units is
\begin{align*}
  P(D6 > 10) &= 1 - P(D6 \leq 10) \\
             &= 1 - \sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{18^n e^{-18}}{n!}\\
             &\approx .97
\end{align*}
Using R,
\begin{Verbatim}
> 1 - sum(dpois(0:10,18))
[1] 0.9696337
\end{Verbatim}
\end{solution}

\subsubsection*{Queueing Models}

% this problem is ok.
\item \emph{Performance metrics for a queueing system.} Consider a
  single server queueing system with FIFO queue discipline.  For the
  particular day that this system was in operation, the arrival times
  and the service times of the first six customers were
  (0,3,7,9,10,12) and (4,6,2,1,3,1), respectively. Arrival times and
  service times are in minutes.  Compute the average waiting time and
  the average number of customers in the queue for the first six
  customers. It will help to construct a diagram of number in
  system versus time.

First note that the problem description does \emph{not} tell us that
the times between arrivals and/or the service times are exponentially
distributed. So it is not an $M/M/1$ system.
The total delay of all six customers is $0+1+3+3+3+4=14$. The average
waiting time in the queue is the total delay divided by the number
of customers.
\[ W_q = \frac{14}{6} = 2.3333~\text{min} \]
To compute the average number in the queue, weight the time in queue
by the number of customers. In other words, compute the area under the
curve but above one, and then divide by the total time.
\[ L_q = \frac{14}{17} \]

\end{solution}

% this problem needs to be re-written.
\item \emph{Justification for a capital expense.}
  Cars arrive at the Lincoln Tunnel toll gate according to a Poisson
  process with an average rate of 90 cars per hour. The time for passing
  the gate is exponential with mean 38 seconds.  Drivers complain of
  the long waiting time, and authorities are willing to reduce the
  average passing time to 30 seconds by installing automatic toll
  collecting devices, provided two conditions are satisfied: 1) the
  average number of waiting cars in the present system exceeds 5 and
  2) the percentage of the gate idle time with the new device
  installed does not exceed 10\%. Can the new device be justified?

\begin{solution}
\bs
Cars arrive at the rate
\[ \lambda = 90~\text{cars per hour} \times 1/3600 =
  1~\text{car}/40~\text{seconds} \]
We know that $\mu=1/38$
for the current system and $\mu_{\text{new}}=1/30$ for the new
system.
Condition 1 states that the average number of waiting
cars in the current system must exceed 5.
\[ L_s = \frac{\lambda}{\mu-\lambda} = \frac{1/40}{1/38-1/40} = 19 \]
You may have also computed
\[ L_q = \frac{\lambda^2}{\mu(\mu-\lambda)} =
  \frac{(1/40)^2}{(1/38)(1/38 - 1/40)} = 18.05 \]
Either way, the first condition is satisfied. The second condition
states that the percentage of idle time in the new system cannot
exceed 10\%.
\[ p_0 = 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu_{\text{new}}} = 1 - \frac{1/40}{1/30} = .25 \]
The second condition is not satisfied. There is no justification
for the new toll gate device.
\end{solution}

% this problem needs to be re-written
\item \emph{Comparing system configurations.}
  Pete's Market is a small local grocery store with one checkout counter.
  Shoppers arrive at the checkout lane according to a Poisson process,
  with an arrival rate of 15 customers per hour. The checkout service times
  are distributed Exponential with a service rate of 20 customers per hour.
  The manager is considering two options for improving service.
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item Hire a second person to bag groceries while the cashier is scanning
      and collecting money from the customer. With this improved single-server
      operation, the service rate would be increased to 30 customers per hour.
    \item Hire a second person to operate a second checkout counter. The
      two-server operation would have a service rate of 20 customers per
      hour for each server.
  \end{compactenum}
  Determine the improvements that would result, consider the
  relative cost of each option, and make a recommendation to the manager.

\begin{solution}
\bs Let's look at the average number in the queue $L_Q$ and the
average time in queue $W_Q$ as metrics to judge improvement in
system performance. Because the interarrival times and the service
times are exponentially distributed, we can use the results from
section 11.2. Before any improvements are made,
\[ L_q = \frac{\lambda^2}{\mu(\mu-\lambda)} = \frac{15^2}{20(20-15)} = 2.25~\text{cust} \]
and
\[W_q = \frac{L_q}{\lambda} = \frac{2.25}{15} = .15~\text{hour} = 9~\text{min} \]
If they add a second person to the existing single checkout
\[ L_q = \frac{\lambda^2}{\mu(\mu-\lambda)} = \frac{15^2}{30(30-15)} = 0.5~\text{cust} \]
and
\[W_q = \frac{L_q}{\lambda} = \frac{0.5}{15} = 0.0333~\text{hour} = 2~\text{min} \]
and if they add a completely separate second checkout then we
need to use the formulas from section 11.3 for a two-server operation. First,
\[ P_0 = \frac{1}{\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\frac{\left(\lambda/\mu\right)^n}{n!} + \frac{\left(\lambda/\mu\right)^k}{k!}\left(\frac{k\mu}{k\mu-\lambda}\right)} \]
where $k=2$ servers. Then
\[ L_q = \frac{\left(\lambda/\mu\right)^k\lambda\mu}{(k-1)!(k\mu-\lambda)^2}P_0 \]
and
\[W_q = \frac{L_q}{\lambda}  \]
Plugging values, I got $P_0=0.4545$, $L_q=0.123$, and $W_q=0.0082$ hours or 0.5 minutes.
Considering the relative improvement and the cost
of adding a second checkout, I would recommend option a). That is, to
add a second person to the existing checkout. The average number in
queue and the average time in queue appear to be acceptable for a
grocery store.
\end{solution}


\end{enumerate}
