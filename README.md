This is the repository for the open textbook "An Introduction to Prescriptive and Predictive Modeling". The book is intended to be a practical introduction to the use of mathematical modeling techniques to solve decision problems that arise in various industrial settings. Examples are drawn from manufacturing, finance, sports, healthcare, retail, transportation, and other areas. To solve any such problem of practical size, proficiency with mathematical and statistical computing software is required. We use the algebraic modeling language GAMS for solving mathematical programming problems and we use the R programming language for obtaining answers to statistical computing problems; however, the methodologies stand on their own and the book can be used with other programming langauges. GAMS code and listings are provided in the src/ directory. R code, output, and discussion are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks (also in the src/ directory). We hope that someone will find the book to be useful :).

NOTE: This book is a work-in-progress! Comments are welcome.
