The book provides practical introduction to the use of mathematical
modeling and statistical computing techniques to solve decision
problems that arise in various industrial settings. Examples are drawn
from manufacturing, finance, sports, healthcare, retail,
transportation, and other areas. In realistic settings, proficiency
with mathematical and statistical computing software is required to
solve these problems. We use the algebraic modeling language GAMS for
solving mathematical programming problems and we use the R programming
language for obtaining answers to statistical computing problems;
however, the methodologies that are developed stand on their own and
the book can be used with other programming langauges. GAMS code and
listings are provided via github in the gams/ directory. R code,
output, and discussion are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks
in the src/ directory. The github repository for the book is
\url{https://github.com/bx549/IPPM}.  We hope that students as well as
practicing engineers and analysts will find the book to be useful.

NOTE: This book is a work-in-progress and it will not be in any sort of usable form until Fall 2021 at the earliest. Comments are welcome!
