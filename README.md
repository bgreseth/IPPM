This is the repository for the open textbook "An Introduction to Prescriptive and Predictive Modeling". The book is intended to be a practical introduction to the use of mathematical modeling techniques to solve decision problems that arise in various industrial settings. Examples are drawn from manufacturing, finance, sports, healthcare, retail, transportation, and other areas. Proficiency with mathematical and statistical computing software is an important skill for the engineer/analyst. We use the algebraic modeling language GAMS for solving mathematical programming problems and we use the R programming language for obtaining answers to statistical computing problems; however, the book can used with other programming langauges.
