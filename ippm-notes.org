chapter 3 

"structuring a decision problem" exercise 1

"The lost dog" exercise 7 needs a new context.

"An optimal strategy for a chess match." execise 10 needs a new
context. The idea here is that the decisions are made over two time
steps. The decision tree is hand-written. I will write the LaTeX code
for the decision tree once we have written the problem context.
(see tree-chess-match.pdf)

chapter 1

"Maximum flow through a network" exercise 5

"Supplies for a multi-day event" exercise 8
(see car-races.pdf)

"Laundering napkins" exercise 9
(see napkin-laundering.pdf)

"A maxi-min problem" exercise 14.
(see gambler.mod on github in gams/ directory)

ch 2

"Stocking a seasonal item" exercise 17
Can we obtain a solution via simulation (using R)?

"The risk of beging out of stock" exercise 19
Can we implement in R?

Please see the example R code for determining how many Thanksgiving
Turkeys Tom the grocer should order. I put this example in chapter 2
in section 2.5 (it will come later in the section, but it's there
now.)
